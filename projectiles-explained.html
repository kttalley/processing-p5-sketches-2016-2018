/*

though it says function this is really a
class or an object. the basic premise is that
there are seperate instances of this object and
each instance knows its own attributes, but
none of the attributes of the others.

an instance is just a specific reference of that class.
an attribute is just a specific part of that class... such as a
variable or function.

for example, 'player' knows that its x starts at 100,
its y starts at 200, its direction is 1 and its speed is 3,
but if we said 'player2 = new Player(50,100,-1,4);',
though 'player2' and 'player' are instances of the same class, the
'this.' illustrates that those variables are specific to those instances
or for example 'player' and 'player2' know their own speeds, but not
eachothers.
